        <p>To study the impact of music on risk aversion in context to economic decision making. -- High tempo music would illicit more risk-taking behaviour in comparison to low tempo music. The study will last for a period of around 40 days. Every participant will spend about 30-45 minutes doing the Ballon analogue risk task while being subjected to either of the three treatment groups- low tempo music, high tempo music or no music. This study is being conducted as a part of the dissertation for the MSc. Behavioural economics course.</p>
